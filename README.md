# Anonymous Zether in Javascript

Zether solidity contracts developed by J.P. Morgan and implemented in pure Javascript.

Todo by priorities:

    1. Paying gas in Zether. It will enable Zether to be used as a native currency to pay the gas in Zether to the miners accepting it as gas.

Additionally, we could add a few more features:

    1. Proving the amount to the receiver without revealing the sender address.


## Special thanks

We want to express our gratitude for the implementation and the help offered on slack and github to:
